# Legacy CLI Tools

This directory contains the original command-line interface (CLI) tools for the Entity Manager. These tools have been superseded by the Home Assistant integration but are preserved here for reference.

## Contents

- `rename_entities.py` - Original CLI tool for batch entity renaming
- `web_ui.py` - Flask-based web interface
- `ha_client.py` & `ha_websocket.py` - Direct API clients (no longer needed)
- Various utility scripts and modules

## Note

**These tools are deprecated.** Please use the Home Assistant integration instead:
1. Install via HACS
2. Use the provided services for entity management

The integration provides the same functionality through Home Assistant's native interface.
